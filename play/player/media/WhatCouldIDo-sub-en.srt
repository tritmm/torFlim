1
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:23,421
How can we find the love and warmth from yesterday
How can we find the love and warmth from yesterday

2
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:30,628
How shall our kiss ignite passion, displace sorrow

3
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:39,272
How can I stop this pain that plagues me every night

4
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:46,527
How can I make you see that I only have you

5
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:53,504
How can we start to thaw the heart that has frozen

6
00:00:54,511 --> 00:01:00,705
How shall I waken from this dream and cease drifting

7
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:09,26
Cause I have bore these flaming scars, I don’t dare dream for much

8
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:16,727
How can we stop in time to seek those days we’d lost

9
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:22,303
My love, please know I’ll always need you

10
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:26,112
To warm and shield this fragile heart

11
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:30,577
With you winter shall melt away

12
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:35,589
Those loving words, I try to grasp

13
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:41,130
But the love in you fades as fleeting clouds

14
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:46,690
We just keep drifting apart

15
00:01:47,31 --> 00:01:52,280
My love, please know I’m always by you

16
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:56,119
Though the clouds may shroud our dreams

17
00:01:56,255 --> 00:02:00,490
Though you forget what we once felt

18
00:02:02,46 --> 00:02:05,647
My love’s unchanged, still unspoken

19
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:11,190
Yet that vision of us is out of reach

20
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:17,630
I’ll always love you as I do today

21
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:40,130
How can we start to thaw the heart that has frozen

22
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:47,720
How shall I waken from this dream and cease drifting

23
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:56,60
Cause I have bore these flaming scars, I don’t dare dream for much

24
00:02:56,241 --> 00:03:03,710
How can we stop in time to seek those days we’d lost

25
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:09,40
My love, please know I’ll always need you

26
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:13,70
To warm and shield this fragile heart

27
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:17,870
With you winter shall melt away

28
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,430
Those loving words, I try to grasp

29
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:28,190
But the love in you fades as fleeting clouds

30
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:33,840
We just keep drifting apart

31
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:39,330
My love, please know I’m always by you

32
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:42,940
Though the clouds may shroud our dreams

33
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:47,220
Though you forget what we once felt

34
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:52,640
My love’s unchanged, still unspoken

35
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:58,160
Yet that vision of us is out of reach

36
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:05,380
 I’ll always love you as I do today

37
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:11,210
My love, please know I’m always by you

38
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,980
Though the clouds may shroud our dreams

39
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,180
Though you forget what we once felt

40
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,349
My love’s unchanged, still unspoken

41
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,860
Yet that vision of us is out of reach

42
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,650
 I’ll always love you as I do today

43
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:48,530
 I’ll always love you as I do today
